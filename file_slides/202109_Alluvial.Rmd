# Introduction

## Background

* Show the flow and change in frequencies as process flows between between states (in our case, variables) 

* Can visualize the relationship between many categorical variables at once, including the status variable

* Investigators love them, be are often interpreted incorrectly!

* We'll be using the `ggalluvial` package, a ggplot2 extension for alluvial plots

## Some vocabulary 

* Axis: variable(s) from your dataset; data are grouped/stacked vertically and at certain horiztonal positions across normal x-axis (period and cancer type in the plot above)

* Strata: the groupings of each axis variable (think factor levels of categorical variable; pre-covid and covid for period)

* Alluvia: horizontal splines that are distributed across the plot; identified by vertical position on axis and fill color (treatment)

* Flows: segments of alluvial between axes

* Lodes: where the alluvia intersect the stata; cannot visualize in plots. Can imagine as rectangular box that continues from the flows through the strata


# Data types

* Three major types (wide, long, and tabular/array)

* We will focus on wide and long (like the arrangement for repeated measures data) 


## Wide format

* We will use the Arthritis dataset from the `vcd` package
* Each row = grouping of observations that take certain value of each variable
* Each variable has own column
* Include an additional column the tallies the combinations of the variables
* One row per alluvium 


```{r, include= TRUE, echo = TRUE}

data(Arthritis)

Arthritis %>% group_by(Treatment, Sex, Improved) %>% tally()

Arthritis_grp <- Arthritis %>% group_by(Treatment, Sex, Improved) %>% tally()
Arthritis_grp %>%
ggplot(
  aes(y = n, axis1 = Treatment, axis2 = Sex)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Treatment", "Sex"), expand = c(.2, .05)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Improved)) +
  geom_stratum() +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), min.y = 5) +
  ggtitle("Improvement pathways",
          "By treatment and gender") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1")



```

* Notice how there are not any gaps or white spaces in the above plot
* Height of the plot = cumulative sum of all observations in data set

## Lodes/long format

* We can convert the above dataset into lodes (long) format using the `to_lodes_form()` function
* One row per lode
* “gathering” (dplyr) of the axis columns to create axis-stratum pairs
* Useful for repeated measures data (see additional example below)

```{r, include=T,echo=T}

Arthritis_lodes <- to_lodes_form(as.data.frame(Arthritis_grp),
                           axes = 1:3,
                           id = "Cohort")


Arthritis_lodes

is_lodes_form(Arthritis_lodes, key = x, value = stratum, id = Cohort, silent = TRUE)

```

In the above transformed data we have the following:

* x: the axis variable that is plotted on the x axis
* stratum: the different levels that each axis variable can assume
* alluvium: the id assigned to each axis-stratum pair


### Vaccinations data

* Let's look at the vaccinations data, which is a more applicable example of long format (response from one question from three surveys)

```{r, include=T, echo=T}

data(vaccinations)

vaccinations <- vaccinations %>% 
                mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, "Always", "Sometimes", 
                                                       "Never", "Missing"))

ggplot(vaccinations,
       aes(x = survey, stratum = response, alluvium = subject,
           y = freq,
           fill = response, label = response)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(.1, .1)) +
  geom_flow() +
  geom_stratum(alpha = .5) +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  xlab("Survey") +
  ggtitle("Vaccination survey responses (one question per survey)")




  
```

* Notice in the above plot there is one stratum where the text does not fit well

* To fix the latter we can set a parameter `aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), min.y = 8)` to restrict labeling to a certain vertical height

```{r, include=T, echo=T}

ggplot(vaccinations,
       aes(x = survey, stratum = response, alluvium = subject,
           y = freq,
           fill = response, label = response)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(.1, .1)) +
  geom_flow() +
  geom_stratum(alpha = .5) +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), min.y = 8) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  xlab("Survey") +
  ggtitle("Vaccination survey responses (one question per survey)")

```

**Notes**

* The geom_alluvium() differs from geom_flow() - depends on the type of dataset and the purpose of the plot!

* Regarding missing values, in the plot above the removal would result in gaps whereas in the earlier plots this would not occur (depends on type of data) 


# Additional customizations

* We'll revisit the arthritis dataset

## Curve types

* Type of curve used to produce flows
* Default: "xspline" (approximation splines using 4 points per curve)
* Other options: "linear", "cubic", "quintic", "sine", "arctangent", and "sigmoid" (produce interpolation splines between points along the graphs of functions of the associated type)

### Linear
```{r, include= TRUE, echo = TRUE}

Arthritis_grp %>%

  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Improved), curve_type = "linear") +
  geom_stratum() +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), min.y = 5) +
  ggtitle("Improvement pathways",
          "By treatment and gender") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1")



```

### Cubic
```{r, include= TRUE, echo = TRUE}

  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Treatment", "Sex"), expand = c(.2, .05)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Improved), curve_type = "cubic") +
  geom_stratum() +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), min.y = 5) +
  ggtitle("Improvement pathways",
          "By treatment and gender") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1")



```


## Color

  geom_stratum() +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), min.y = 5) +
  ggtitle("Improvement pathways",
          "By treatment and gender") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2")
